- Hunt longer into morning hours

## üå°Ô∏è Weather & Moon Interaction Factors

### Prime Conditions (Apply These Filters)
1. **New moon + Cold front** = Exceptional movement
2. **Approaching storm + Any moon phase** = Increased activity  
3. **Post-full moon + Cool mornings** = Good morning hunts
