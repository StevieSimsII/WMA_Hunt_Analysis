# Historical Draw Hunt Analysis Framework
**Based on MDWFP Draw Hunt Statistics for Strategic Planning**

## Available Historical Data Source
- **2024-25 Deer Draw Hunt Stats:** https://xnet2.mdwfp.com/xNet_Files/Wildlife/WMA_Deer_Draw_Hunt_Stats_(2024-25).pdf
- **Turkey Draw Stats (4-year trend):** Available for pattern analysis
- **Waterfowl Draw Stats:** 2024-25 data available

## Key Metrics to Analyze from Historical Data

### 1. Success Rate Analysis
- **Application-to-permit ratios** by WMA location
- **Most competitive hunts** (lowest success rates)
- **Hidden gem opportunities** (higher success rates)

### 2. WMA Performance Trends
Based on our current verified locations, historical analysis should focus on:
- **Mahannah WMA** - Success rates across hunt types
- **Phil Bryant WMA** (all units) - Most popular location
- **Sky Lake WMA** - Primitive weapon popularity
- **Twin Oaks WMA** - Application demand trends
- **Riverfront WMA** - Limited primitive weapon data

### 3. Hunt Type Demand Analysis
- **Archery vs Gun vs Primitive Weapon** popularity
- **Seasonal demand patterns** (early vs late season)
- **Group hunt competition levels**

## Strategic Application Insights

### Based on Our Current Hunt Inventory:

#### High-Competition Hunts (Likely):
- **Phil Bryant (Goose Lake Unit)** - 15 archery hunts with 24 permits each
- **Phil Bryant (Ten Point Unit)** - Premium archery and gun opportunities
- **Peak rut hunts** (Dec 29-Jan 4) - Only 2 opportunities total

#### Potential "Sleeper" Opportunities:
- **Riverfront WMA** - Only 4 primitive weapon hunts (may have lower competition)
- **Sky Lake late season** - 16 total primitive weapon hunts
- **Twin Oaks** - 25 total hunt opportunities across archery and primitive

### Application Strategy Framework

#### Priority Tier 1: Must-Apply Hunts
1. **Phil Bryant (Goose Lake Unit) - Archery Hunt 14** (Jan 1-4, Peak Rut)
2. **Sky Lake - PW Hunt 8** (Jan 1-3, Peak Rut)
3. **Phil Bryant units - Dec 18 hunts** (Optimal moon phase)

#### Priority Tier 2: High-Value Backups
- **Mahannah Gun Hunts** (Dec 18-21, good permits)
- **Twin Oaks Primitive Weapon** (Dec 18-21, potentially less competitive)
- **Phil Bryant (Backwoods Unit) Group** (If applying with partners)

#### Priority Tier 3: Volume Strategy
- **Early season archery** (Oct-Nov at Phil Bryant units)
- **Sky Lake primitive weapon** (Multiple opportunities)
- **Mahannah archery** (Consistent permit availability)

## Recommended Analysis Process

### Step 1: Historical Data Review
When the PDF is accessible, extract:
- Success rates by WMA and hunt type
- Application volume trends
- Most/least competitive opportunities

### Step 2: Strategic Application Planning
- **Primary choices:** Highest scoring hunts from our analysis
- **Secondary choices:** High-value hunts with better odds
- **Safety choices:** Opportunities with historical higher success rates

### Step 3: Risk Management
- **Don't put all choices in Phil Bryant units** (likely high competition)
- **Mix hunt types** to increase overall success odds
- **Consider less popular dates** that still align with rut timing

## Integration with Current Analysis

Our moon phase/rut timing analysis provides the **WHAT** (best hunt opportunities), while historical draw statistics provide the **HOW LIKELY** (realistic success chances).

### Combined Strategy:
1. **Identify optimal hunts** using our enhanced scoring system
2. **Assess competition levels** using historical draw data
3. **Build application portfolio** balancing quality vs. probability
4. **Time applications strategically** based on demand patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Access 2024-25 PDF data** for detailed statistics
2. **Cross-reference our top-rated hunts** with historical success rates
3. **Develop weighted application strategy** considering both hunt quality and draw odds
4. **Create application timeline** with primary/backup choices

This framework allows hunters to make informed decisions balancing **hunt quality** (our current analysis) with **realistic success probability** (historical data).
